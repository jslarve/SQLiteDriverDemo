# SQLiteDriverDemo
## Sample Application for using Clarion's SQLite Driver for in-Memory Tables

This was created in Clarion 11, but might also work as far back as Clarion 9.

There are two SQL scripts included with this demo (Data generated by mockaroo.com, but I modified it by hand to work better in SQLite).
Create.mem.Data.sql is the CREATE TABLE statement. 
mem.Data.sql is the INSERT of 500 rows of data.

There is a max of 500 inserts that you can do in one SQLite command. But you can do multiple executions to get more data in there.

NOTE: This demo ships with a newer version of sqlite than ships with Clarion. The shipping one will still work, but it's from 2012 and there are a lot more features in the newest.
